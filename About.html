        <h4> Blockchain </h4> 
        
        <p>
            A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable record of data that is managed by cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) are secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).
So, what is so special about it and why are we saying that it has industry disrupting capabilities?
The blockchain network has no central authority — it is the very definition of a democratized system. Since it is a shared and immutable ledger, the information in it is open for anyone and everyone to see. Hence, anything that is built on the blockchain is by its very nature transparent and everyone involved is accountable for their actions.
A blockchain carries no transaction cost. (An infrastructure cost yes, but no transaction cost.) The blockchain is a simple yet ingenious way of passing information from A to B in a fully automated and safe manner. One party to a transaction initiates the process by creating a block. This block is verified by thousands, perhaps millions of computers distributed around the net. The verified block is added to a chain, which is stored across the net, creating not just a unique record, but a unique record with a unique history. Falsifying a single record would mean falsifying the entire chain in millions of instances. That is virtually impossible. Bitcoin uses this model for monetary transactions, but it can be deployed in many others ways.
Think of a railway company. We buy tickets on an app or the web. The credit card company takes a cut for processing the transaction. With blockchain, not only can the railway operator save on credit card processing fees, it can move the entire ticketing process to the blockchain. The two parties in the transaction are the railway company and the passenger. The ticket is a block, which will be added to a ticket blockchain. Just as a monetary transaction on blockchain is a unique, independently verifiable and unfalsifiable record (like Bitcoin), so can your ticket be. Incidentally, the final ticket blockchain is also a record of all transactions for, say, a certain train route, or even the entire train network, comprising every ticket ever sold, every journey ever taken.
But the key here is this: it’s free. Not only can the blockchain transfer and store money, but it can also replace all processes and business models which rely on charging a small fee for a transaction. Or any other transaction between two parties.

     <h4> Autonomous Things (Robots) </h4>    
     <p> What is autonomy? Autonomy is the ability to make your own decisions. In humans, autonomy allows us to do the most meaningful, not to mention meaningless, tasks. This includes things like walking, talking, waving, opening doors, pushing buttons and changing light bulbs. In robots, autonomy is really no different.
Autonomous robots, just like humans, also have the ability to make their own decisions and then perform an action accordingly. A truly autonomous robot is one that can perceive its environment, make decisions based on what it perceives and/or has been programmed to recognize and then actuate a movement or manipulation within that environment. With respect to mobility, for example, these decision-based actions include but are not limited to the following basics: starting, stopping, and maneuvering around obstacles that are in their way.

The key components to the autonomous action mentioned above include these three key concepts: perception, decision, and actuation.
Perception:
For people, this is mostly our five senses. Eyes, ears, skin, hair, and many other biological mechanisms are used to perceive the world. For a robot, perception means sensors. Laser scanners, stereo vision cameras (eyes), bump sensors (skin and hair), force-torque sensors (muscle strain), and even spectrometers (smell) are used as input devices for a robot. And with both people and robots alike, we can now think of other kinds of information inputs, like the endless supply of data from the internet; in fact one might think of the internet of things as an endless sea of sensors with very long wires reaching back to the robots that might use them.
Decision:
For humans, it’s our brain that makes most of the decisions; or in some cases our “gut” or even our neural system. Our brains make higher level decisions, about where we want to walk for example. But sometimes our biology supersedes our brains and our bodies react to things before our brains even know what’s happening. Those reflexive behaviors, like eyelids closing faster than a flying piece of debris, are operating faster and without the permission of our brains for the purpose of keeping us safe. Autonomous robots have a similar decision making structure. The “brain” of a robot is usually a computer, and it makes decisions based on what its mission is, and what information it receives along the way. But robots also have a capability that is similar to the neurological system in humans, where their safety systems operate faster and without the permission of the brain; in fact in robots, the brain operates with the permission of the safety system. In an autonomous robot, we call that “neurological” system an embedded system; it operates faster and with higher authority than the computer that is executing a mission plan and parsing data. This is how the robot can decide to stop if it notices an obstacle in its way, if it detects a problem with itself, or if its emergency-stop button is pressed.
Actuation:
People have actuators called muscles. They take all kinds of shapes and perform all kinds of functions, from grabbing a cup of coffee to beating our hearts and pumping blood. Robots can have all kinds of actuators too, and a motor of some kind is usually at the heart of the actuator. Whether it’s a wheel, linear actuator, or hydraulic ram, there’s always a motor converting energy into movement. The endless permutations of actuators provide a lifetime of joy and fascination for the people who create and work with them.

<h4>Immersive Experience</h4>

<p> An immersive experience is an illusory environment that completely surrounds you such that you feel that you are inside it and part of it. The term is associated with technology environments that command the senses such as virtual reality and mixed reality. The following are illustrative examples of immersive experience.
Education
Pulling digital elements into the classroom with mixed reality or transforming the learning environment with virtual reality. For example, exploring the surface of Mars as part of a science lesson.
Art
Contemporary art that is designed to surround the visitor. Immersive experiences can be accomplished without technology as art can transform reality on its own.
Restaurants
Restaurants that simulate an unreal environment. For example, a restaurant designed to look like a ninja village complete with actors that draw visitors into a story.
Events
Events such as a concert designed to transform the venue such that it resembles a different reality.
Entertainment
Theme parks, movies and games that completely surround you. This includes pervasive games that draw virtual elements into the real world. In theory, movies could also occur in the real world.
Fitness
Physical activity in a virtual environment that may resemble a game or provide you with excessive real time information about your body.
Efficiency
Avoiding the cost of travel by simulating work environments. For example, sending your digital twin to a sales meeting in Berlin.
Productivity
Integration of digital elements into work environments as a tool that makes people more productive. For example, a video editor that steps into a film to edit it.
Risk
Tools to reduce risk. For example, mixed reality that provides a surgeon with informative visuals such as highlighting or labeling diseased tissue during surgery that increase accuracy and reduces the chance of a mistake.
