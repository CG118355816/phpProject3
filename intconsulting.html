        <p> I always had an interest in helping people whatever way I could. Also I am very good at absorbing 
            information particularly from books which is why I read a lot.<br> I decided this was a career I wanted to 
            pursue so I recently started my own consulting service.<br> It is a top quality service in which we supply the latest of consulting offerings to the market.<br>
            Our name - Granny's Consulting service, I created this name because Isn't it always our granny's who give the best advice! </p>
